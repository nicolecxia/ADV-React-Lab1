# ADV-React-Lab1

Instructions
TASKS: ToDo App
For this lab, you need to do the following:

1:(3 POINTS) Add a task with Title and Status. When a new task is added, the status will be 'due/false' as default. The possible statuses are 'due/false' or 'done/true'.

2:(2 POINTS) Add the feature to EDIT the STATUS attributes from the task. The change of the status MUST be done directly from the task on the list, to improve usability. In other words, the user must be able to tap a switch, checkbox or any other touchable component in the task card to easily change its status.

3:(2 POINTS) Add the feature to DELETE the selected task from the list. The task MUST be deleted directly from the list, to improve usability. In other words, the user must be able to tap an icon or any other touchable component in the task card to easily delete.

4:(3 POINTS) Create a verification to allow the creation of the task ONLY when there is a title. Do not overcomplicate it. This could be done, for example, by simply disabling the `ADD TASK` button when the input field is empty.
